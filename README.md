# The Game of Hilo!
# Hilo is a game in which the player guesses if the next card drawn by the dealer will be higher or lower than the previous one. Points are won or lost based on whether or not the player guessed correctly.
# If the player guesses correctly, they will gain 100 points!
# If the player guesses wrong, they will lose 75 points!
# If the player's total score reaches zero, they lose!
# This program is split into three different python files; director.py, card.py, and __main__.py.
# Director.py is essentially the director of the game and uses the user's input to decide whether they guessed correctly.
# Card.py is in charge of choosing random cards between the numbers 1-13.
# __main__.py runs the program.
# This program requires the latest version of Python.
